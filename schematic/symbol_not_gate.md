# CMOS Inverter Symbol – Description

## 📌 Overview
This symbol represents a CMOS NOT gate (inverter) derived from the underlying transistor-level schematic using PMOS and NMOS devices. The symbol abstracts the internal transistor implementation and enables easy reuse of the inverter as a functional logic block in higher-level designs.

## 📌 Symbol Description
The inverter symbol provides a simplified logical representation while preserving correct electrical connectivity. It exposes only the essential pins required for system-level integration, allowing the designer to focus on functional behavior without referencing the internal transistor structure.

## 📌 Usage
This symbol is intended for use in digital logic design, buffering, delay elements, and ring oscillator implementations, enabling hierarchical and modular VLSI design.

## 📌 Conclusion
The CMOS inverter symbol simplifies schematic-level design while maintaining accurate functional behavior. It serves as a foundational reusable block for constructing complex digital and mixed-signal systems.<br>
